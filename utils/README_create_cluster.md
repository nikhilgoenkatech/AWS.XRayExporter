VPC_CIDR="10.100.0.0/16"            # CIDR block for the VPC
KEY_NAME="your-key-name"            # EC2 key pair name
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="123456789012"       # Your AWS account ID
ROLE_NAME="EKSClusterRole"          # IAM role for EKS cluster
NODE_ROLE_NAME="EKSNodeRole"        # IAM role for worker nodes
EBS_ROLE_NAME="EBSCSIRole"          # (Optional) Role for EBS CSI driver

./create-cluster.sh
```

The script will:

1. Create a VPC with public and private subnets  
2. Set up Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway  
3. Configure route tables for public and private subnets  
4. Create an EKS cluster with private subnets
5. Wait for the cluster to become active
6. Create a managed node group with SSH access
